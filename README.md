# Machine Learning Lab (MLDM Grad Program)

#### Authors: Austin Schwinn & Usama Javaid

#### Dates: Jan - Mar 2017

#### Subject: Repository for my grad school machine learning lab

## Lab 1: 
	Exercise 1: Scikit-Learn practice with Iris dataset. Matplotlib.
	Exercise 2: Create Kayak Race CSV in data subfolder 
	Exercise 3: KNN with Scikit & Iris
	Exercise 4: Decision Trees with Scikit & Iris.
	Exercise 5: Neural Networkds & Multilayer Perceptron Classifier for digit recognition
	Exercise 6: Using original Kayak Race CSV to test KNN, Decision Trees, and MLP NN

	Note: Tree output visualizations available in Outputs subdirectory of Data and Dependencies

## Lab 2: 
	Exercise 1: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with weather example
	Exercise 2: HMM with string and states
	Exercise 3: HMM for sequence of string states

## Lab 3: 
	Exercise 1: SVM simple example
	Exercise 2: SVM with randomly generated data set
	Exercise 3: SVM with Moon dataset
	Exercise 4: SVM with Iris dataset
	Exercise 5: SVM with Ozone dataset

	Note: Ozone dataset is provided by MeteoFrance. Below are description for the attributes.
		- JOUR: type of day, holiday (1) or not (0).
		- O3obs: ozone concentration observed the next day at 17h (local time), often at the maximum pollution rate.
		- MOCAGE: prediction of the pollution made by a deterministic model
		- TEMPE: temperature for the next day at 17h.
		- RMH2O: humidity rate
		- NO2: nitrogen dioxide concentration
		- NO: nitric oxide concentration
		- STATION: place from where the observations are taken (Aix-en-Provence, Rambouillet, Munchhausen, Cadarache or Plan de Cuques)
		- VentMOD: wind strength
		- VentANG: wind orientation
